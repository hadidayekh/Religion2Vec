# Religion2Vec
Religion2Vec provides a web interface to explore semantic analysis of words in the corpuses of the three main religious books: the Quran, the Bible, and the Torah.<br>

### This branch will contain a tool to visualize any trained Word2Vec model. It currently contains a tool for analyzing the Bible ONLY. For the religious books case study, please refer to the Religion2Vec branch.
